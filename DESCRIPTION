Title: Develop, Maintain And Refine SNAPverse Documentation
Description: This package provides a collection of utility functions for the development, maintenance and refinement of documentation
    for SNAPverse packages. The core of the documentation for a SNAPverse package is based around pkgdown, which builds documentation
    for each package individually. The snapsite package assists with thematic tweaks and cohesive, standardized integration across
    multiple packages in the verse, helping to bring the SNAPverse together. snapsite is a satellite package in the verse.
